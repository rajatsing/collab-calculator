# How to run this app
> To start the server, run `go run *.go` from the root repo.

> To start the client, **for the first time**, first you need to install the dependency. To do all that do the following

```
cd client/
npm i
ng serve
```
>  No need to run `npm i` again, since all the dependencies are in place.
